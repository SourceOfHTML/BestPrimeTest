# Best Prime Test Ever

Think, dear programmers; have you ever wanted to test the primality of a number between 3 and (2^63) - 1? No? Cool.

In any case, this program that is held together by rubber bands and tears SHOULD calculate all the primes amongst numbers that a signed long can handle. If it doesn't work for a specific case, let me know.

Please enjoy and try to ignore the horribleness of the code
